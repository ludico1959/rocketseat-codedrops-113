## üíª Run locally

If you want to run the project on your local machine, just follow the steps below:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Starting...

To get started, you simply need to clone the project repository on your machine and install the dependencies.

```
  git clone https://github.com/ludico1959/rocketseat-codedrops-113
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Requirements

Before installing the dependencies from the project, you need to have already installed on your machine:

* **Node.Js**: If you don't have it, just download [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
* **Docker**: If you don't have it, just download [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).*


### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Setting a Docker container with PostgreSQL database 

We will use a Docker container to create a PostgreSQL database. For that, you first need open command-line interpreter (here I am using Git Bash) and seach for the root folder and type the following command to get the postgres official image and set the container's settings:
```
  docker-compose up -d
```
After that, just type to see the container's ID. 
```
  docker-compose up -d
```
Now type the command below, just changing the placeholder %ID% for the ID of the container.
```
  winpty docker exec -it %ID% bash
```
For openning the PostgreSQL with the following line:
```
  psql -U postgres
```
And create a database and connect to it using the commands below, but before, just change the placeholder %DATABASENAME% for your database name (mine was called **code_drops_crud**):
```
  create database %DATABASENAME%
```
```
\c code_drops_crud
```


### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Setting the environment variables

You have a file called **.env.example** in the root folder. There, you just need to set the environment variables as you like and change it's name to **.env**.


### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Instaling dependencies

Open cmd.exe (if you are using Windows) or another command-line interpreter and enter the path of your project. Then just type the following instruction: 

```
npm install
```

By typing the statement above, it will automatically download all the dependencies listed in the package.json file inside the folder **node_modules**:


### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Running the application

Well, now on the same cmd.exe screen (or another command-line interpreter), just start the server for the project to run locally typing:

```
yarn dev
```

## üìÆ Testing endpoints

You can test the CRUD operations using an API test tool like Postman or Insomnia! Just import the file named is **postman_collection.json**.

* **Postman**: If you don't have it, just download it [here](https://www.postman.com/downloads/). 
* **Insomnia**: If you don't have it, just download it [here](https://insomnia.rest/download/).
